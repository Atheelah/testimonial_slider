          <p class="paragraph">
            Perhaps the most obvious message in Frozen is that it's good to be
            courageous. Elsa fleeing her home to live on her own was bold; Anna
            following her was even more so. Having a feisty streak can be a very
            good thing! Elsa taught us that you should learn to let it go! You
            should be yourself and never apologise for it

          <h3 class="h3">-Goddess Of The Ocean-</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Having Patience Is Always Beneficial: Patience is the key to
            happiness, they say, and nearly the entire film embodies that
            belief. For example, Moana must find enough patience to learn how to
            sail, patience in Maui who doesn't trust her at first, and patience
            throughout her entire journey.

          <h3 class="h3">-Goddess Of The Palace-</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Unlike most of Disney's princesses, Jasmine is a supporting
            character in her own film, taking the secondary role of the love
            interest.Aladdin taught us the importance of friendship both good
            and bad. Aladdin chooses friendship over material possessions.

          <p class="paragraph">
            The moral lesson behind the story is to believe in ones self and
            take chances and not let anything hold you back from achieving
            greater things, and finding who you are in life.teaches us that the
            more you know, the cooler you are. You just have to notice them.
